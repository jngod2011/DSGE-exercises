This module has been developed specifically with the application in mind,

It mainly serves as a reference for the exercises I do following the textbook
'Bayesian Estimation of DSGE Models' by E.P. Herbst and F. Schorfheide.
Sometimes I draw some inspiration also from https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/.
