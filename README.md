# DSGE exercises

Here I learn how to solve and estimate a series of DSGE models.
I also write small summaries to keep track of stuff.
Mainly my own exercises.

The main reference for these exercises is [Bayesian Estimation of DSGE Models, by E.P. Herbst and F. Schorfheide](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10612.html).
